# tic-tac-toe-v3
In this project, you'll build a functional, two-person Tic Tac Toe game. You'll use the provided mockups, HTML, CSS and image files to create a game that requires players to add their names, take turns adding an X or O to the game board, and announce when the game ends. You'll need to keep track of the state of the game -- whose turn it is, where the X's and O's are on the board, and whether the game is a draw or, if not, who won and lost.
